            <p>Tap dancing is a rhythmic, exciting and dynamic form of dance.  It has a rich history that 
                began over a hundred years ago, and has evolved into the modern tap style that we all know 
                and love.<br><br>Today, two major variations of tap exist: rhythm (jazz) tap and Broadway.  
                Broadway tap focuses on dance; it is widely performed in musical theater. Rhythm tap focuses 
                on musicality, and practitioners consider themselves to be a part of the jazz tradition.

            <ol class="left">
                <li class="bold">Tap dancing is the combination of Irish clog & step dancing with the rhythms of West African drumming.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the mid 1600s, Scottish and Irish laborers brought their social dances with them to America. </li>
                        <li>Slaves were inspired by the rapid toe and heel action and added it to West African step dances.</li>
                        <li>The two styles slowly influenced each other forming a hybrid that was both fluid and rhythmic.</li><br>
                    </ul>
                <li>The term “tap” started being used around 1902.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There were two popular techniques. A fast style that used wooden-sole shoes, or Buck-and-Wing, and a smoother style 
                        that used leather-sole shoes, called Soft-Shoe.</li>
                        <li>Eventually, people started to hammer pennies or nails into the toes and heels.</li>
                        <li>The metal plates, or taps, were later added to leather-soled shoes and started being used in a style that combined 
                        elements of both techniques by the 1920s.</li><br>
                    </ul>
                <li>There were many movies made with tap dancing numbers from the 1930s to the 1950s.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tap numbers became an important part of both movies and television.</li>
                        <li>Shirley Temple “tapped” onto the screen at 6 years old.</li>
                        <li>Gene Kelly, introduced a style of tap heavily influenced by ballet.</li>
                        <li>Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, combined tap and ballroom, to create beautiful dance scenes that were often captured 
                        in a single take! </li><br>
                    </ul>
                <li>The first rule of tap is to keep your knees relaxed and your weight in the ball of your foot.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tap dancing takes a great deal of work and dedication. But it is worth it! Taking tap increases your rhythm, 
                            balance, musicality, and showmanship. </li><br>
                    </ul>
                <li>Taps are now screwed onto the bottom of shoes. This is not just to keep them on the shoe!</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The taps can be tightened or loosened to change the sound or “tone” of the shoe.</li>
                        <li>It also means that any pair of hard soled shoes can become tap shoes! This makes for some awesome costume tap shoes 
                            in productions. </li><br>
                    </ul>
